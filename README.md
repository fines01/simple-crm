# SimpleCrm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.  
It's not really that useful as a business application, but it has a nice dashboard.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

You could run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).  
But let's be honest, I didn't do the boring stuff.

## Running end-to-end tests

You could `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. (To use this command, you would need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities)... if there were any. But let’s be real — I didn’t do the boring stuff here either. Consider this more of a 'choose your own adventure' scenario.
